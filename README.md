# [Fix Ruler Mising In Action](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1904693690)

[This mod is no longer maintained as the issue has been fixed by Paradox as of game version 3.0.1]

This mod clones the initial ruler after they lose their first election and assigns them the governor class.

The fix will only be applied once, as the bug is caused by the ruler not being correctly initialized with a pre_ruler_class when the game starts.

This can also be fixed by save game editing, but that's impossible to release as a mod.
